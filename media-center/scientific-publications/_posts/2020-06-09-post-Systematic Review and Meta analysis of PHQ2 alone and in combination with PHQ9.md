<h1><strong>Accuracy of the PHQ-2 Alone and in Combination With the PHQ-9 for Screening to Detect Major Depression: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</strong></h1>
<h4>Brooke Levis, Ying Sun, Chen He... Daniel Fung et al.</h4>
<p><strong>Importance: </strong>The Patient Health Questionnaire depression
module (PHQ-9) is a 9-item self-administered instrument used for detecting
depression and assessing severity of depression. The Patient Health Questionnaire-2
(PHQ-2) consists of the first 2 items of the PHQ-9 (which assess the frequency
of depressed mood and anhedonia) and can be used as a first step to identify
patients for evaluation with the full PHQ-9.</p>
<p><strong>Objective: </strong>To estimate PHQ-2 accuracy alone and combined
with the PHQ-9 for detecting major depression.</p>
<p><strong>Data sources: </strong>MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other
Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (January 2000-May 2018).</p>
<p><strong>Study selection: </strong>Eligible data sets compared PHQ-2 scores
with major depression diagnoses from a validated diagnostic interview.</p>
<p><strong>Data extraction and synthesis: </strong>Individual participant
data were synthesized with bivariate random-effects meta-analysis to estimate
pooled sensitivity and specificity of the PHQ-2 alone among studies using
semistructured, fully structured, or Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (MINI) diagnostic interviews separately and in combination with
the PHQ-9 vs the PHQ-9 alone for studies that used semistructured interviews.
The PHQ-2 score ranges from 0 to 6, and the PHQ-9 score ranges from 0 to
27.</p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>Individual participant data were obtained from
100 of 136 eligible studies (44 318 participants; 4572 with major depression
[10%]; mean [SD] age, 49 [17] years; 59% female). Among studies that used
semistructured interviews, PHQ-2 sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were
0.91 (0.88-0.94) and 0.67 (0.64-0.71) for cutoff scores of 2 or greater
and 0.72 (0.67-0.77) and 0.85 (0.83-0.87) for cutoff scores of 3 or greater.
Sensitivity was significantly greater for semistructured vs fully structured
interviews. Specificity was not significantly different across the types
of interviews. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
was 0.88 (0.86-0.89) for semistructured interviews, 0.82 (0.81-0.84) for
fully structured interviews, and 0.87 (0.85-0.88) for the MINI. There were
no significant subgroup differences. For semistructured interviews, sensitivity
for PHQ-2 scores of 2 or greater followed by PHQ-9 scores of 10 or greater
(0.82 [0.76-0.86]) was not significantly different than PHQ-9 scores of
10 or greater alone (0.86 [0.80-0.90]); specificity for the combination
was significantly but minimally higher (0.87 [0.84-0.89] vs 0.85 [0.82-0.87]).
The area under the curve was 0.90 (0.89-0.91). The combination was estimated
to reduce the number of participants needing to complete the full PHQ-9
by 57% (56%-58%).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions and relevance: </strong>In an individual participant
data meta-analysis of studies that compared PHQ scores with major depression
diagnoses, the combination of PHQ-2 (with cutoff ≥2) followed by PHQ-9
(with cutoff ≥10) had similar sensitivity but higher specificity compared
with PHQ-9 cutoff scores of 10 or greater alone. Further research is needed
to understand the clinical and research value of this combined approach
to screening.</p>
