<h1>The evolution of depression in first-episode psychosis: A naturalistic database study</h1>

<p>Depression is commonly seen in the course of schizophrenia and can occur
during any of the phases of the psychotic illness. The present study examines
the incidence of depression at baseline and de novo depression in first
episode of nonaffective psychoses and the course of depression in the 12
months following first-episode psychosis, any predictive significance of
baseline depression with recurrence of depression in the subsequent phases
of the psychotic illness. The study was conducted with a clinical sample
of 460 patients under the care of a first-episode psychosis programme,
and data relating to duration of untreated psychosis, sociodemographic
data, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), Global Assessment of
Functioning (GAF), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) were collected.
Diagnosis was made by at least two psychiatrists using SCID-1, and depression
was measured by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Statistical analysis
was performed using SAS version 9. We performed multiple logistic regression
analyses to identify the sociodemographic and clinical factors that were
associated with depression. Statistical significance was set at <em>p</em> value
less than 0.05. We found that baseline depression was present in 34.42%
patients with a preponderance of females (<em>p</em> = 0.047) and in those
with secondary education. A suicide attempt is a strong predictor for depression
at baseline. There was lower incidence of depression in those diagnosed
with brief psychotic disorder (<em>p</em> = 0.015) and those with lower
PANSS positive scores (<em>p</em> = 0.017). De novo depression over 12 months
was 9.44%. Depression at 1-year follow-up was significantly predicted by
depression at baseline.</p>
