<p>The NESDA is a multi-site naturalistic cohort study that aims to (1) describe
the long-term course and consequences of depressive and anxiety disorders,
and (2) to integrate biological and psychosocial research paradigms within
an epidemiological approach to examine predictors of the long-term course
and consequences. The findings of NESDA have provided more detailed insight
into the long-term course of depressive and anxiety disorders in adults.
Besides its scientific relevance, this study has contributed to more effective
prevention and treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders.</p>
