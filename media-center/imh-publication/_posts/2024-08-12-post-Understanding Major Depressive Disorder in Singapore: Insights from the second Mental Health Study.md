<p><strong>Background: </strong>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) poses significant
public health challenges globally and in Southeast Asia, with substantial
impairment and disease burden. Understanding its prevalence and associated
risk factors is crucial for effective intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>This study aims to describe the prevalence shifts,
correlates, and comorbidities of MDD in Singapore. Data were collected
from the second Singapore Mental Health Study (SMHS 2016), a national cross-sectional
survey comprising 6126 adult residents. The WHO Composite International
Diagnostic Interview assessed MDD and comorbidities. Statistical analyses,
including logistic regression, were conducted to examine the associations
and trends.</p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>The lifetime weighted prevalence of MDD in SMHS
2016 was 6.2 %, with an overall increase from 5.8 % in 2010. Significant
associations were found between MDD and age, marital status, and comorbid
physical disorders. Young adults and divorced/separated individuals exhibited
higher MDD prevalence. Chronic pain was significantly associated with MDD.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations: </strong>The study's cross-sectional design limits
causal inference, and selective non-response might affect prevalence estimates.
However, the study benefits from a large, nationally representative sample
and standardized methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Young and middle-aged adults, and divorced/separated
individuals demonstrate elevated MDD prevalence, warranting targeted interventions.
Individuals with comorbidities, particularly chronic pain, constitute a
high-risk and vulnerable population. Comprehensive assessment and treatment
plans should involve multidisciplinary teams and integrated care approaches
to better address the complex needs of these individuals. Our study also
highlights specific interventions for schools, families, communities, and
workplaces. Despite Singapore's relatively low prevalence compared to Western
nations, MDD remains cross-culturally valid emphasizing the need for early
intervention and preventive public health measures.</p>
