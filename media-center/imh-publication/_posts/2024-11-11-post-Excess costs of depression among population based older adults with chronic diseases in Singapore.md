<h3>Background</h3>
<p>There is limited evidence on the economic burden of depression among the
older population in Singapore.</p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>We aim to evaluate the impact of depression on healthcare expenditure
and productivity loss among older adults with chronic diseases in Singapore.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>Using the data from the Well-being of the Singapore Elderly study (WiSE),
a 2011 national representative survey of older adults aged 60 years and
above, 2510 respondents were included in this study. The sample comprised
44% male and 56% female respondents with 75% respondents aged between 60
and 74 years old. Healthcare utilisation data was obtained from respondents
and healthcare cost was tabulated by multiplying each service unit by the
unit cost price. These services include care from polyclinic doctors, private
general practitioners (GP), outpatient specialists and inpatient care.
We modelled the relationship of healthcare cost and depression using two-part
models (probit &amp; generalised linear model - loglink and gamma distribution).</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>For total healthcare expenditure, older adults with both depression and
chronic diseases were associated with an average annual incremental cost
of $7940 (95% CI 1490–14400; <em>p</em> = 0.016), compared to those without
these conditions. They were also associated with an average incremental
cost of $257 (95% CI 38.7–475; <em>p</em> = 0.021) for primary care. Likewise,
in the case of specialist outpatient clinics, they had an average incremental
cost of $970 (95% CI 163–1780; <em>p</em> = 0.018). However, for inpatient
setting, the average incremental cost of $6180 (95% CI 418–12800; <em>p</em> = 0.066)
was not significant. Additionally, older adults with depression and chronic
diseases contribute to an annual productivity loss of $676 (95% CI 346–1010; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>This study provides evidence that there are significant incremental costs
associated with depression amongst the older adults with chronic diseases
in Singapore’s primary healthcare setting. The increased somatic presentations
among the depressed older adults and the underdiagnosis of depression in
primary care may contribute to higher utilisation of healthcare resources
which entail higher expenditure. This is one of the first studies to look
at the cost of depression using a representative sample of Singaporean
older adults and taking into account the multi-ethnic nature of the population.
Analyses were restricted to a cross-sectional design, and data relied heavily
on the accuracy of self-report utilisation on health care services which
was subjected to recall bias.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Depression was found to inflate the total healthcare expenditure among
older adults with chronic disease by two-fold. This study provides evidence
that there are significant incremental costs associated with depression
among the older adults with chronic diseases, demonstrating a need for
more resources to improve systematic and clinical care for depressed older
adults with chronic diseases.</p>
