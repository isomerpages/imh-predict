<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>Anxiety and depressive disorders are highly
prevalent mental health conditions worldwide. However, little is known
about their specific prevalence in primary care settings. This study aimed
to determine the prevalence of depression, and anxiety in the primary care
population and identify associated patient characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> We conducted a cross-sectional study using stratified
sampling by age with a self-administered questionnaire survey in Singapore’s
National Healthcare Group Polyclinics from December 2021 to April 2022.
A total score of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) ≥10 represents
clinical depression and a total score of Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7
(GAD-7) ≥10 indicates clinical anxiety. Multivariable logistic regression
was used to identify the factors associated with depression and anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> A total of 5694 patients were approached and
3505 consented to the study (response rate=61.6%). There was a higher prevalence
of coexisting clinical depression and anxiety (DA) (prevalence=5.4%) compared
to clinical depression only (3.3%) and clinical anxiety only (1.9%). The
odds of having DA were higher among those aged 21–39 years (odds ratio
[OR] 13.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.41–33.64) and 40–64 years (OR
2.28; 95% CI 1.03–5.03) compared to those ≥65 years. Women had higher odds
of having DA (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.54–3.50) compared to men. Respondents with
diabetes had higher odds of having DA (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.07–2.94) compared
to those without diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Coexisting clinical depression and anxiety
are significantly present in the primary care setting, especially among
younger individuals, patients with diabetes and women. Mental health screening
programmes should include screening for both depression and anxiety, and
target these at-risk groups.</p>
