<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Depressive disorders are a serious public health concern. Left untreated,
further clinical distress and impairment in important life domains may
arise. Yet, the treatment gap remains large. Prior research has shown that
individuals with depressive disorders prefer seeking help from informal
sources such as family and friends ahead of formal sources. However, this
preference has its disadvantages such as experiencing actual, perceived
and internalized stigmatizing responses from them which may delay or deter
help-seeking. This paper aimed to determine the role of perceived stigma
among family and friends in an individual’s help-seeking behavior.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with patients with
depressive disorders from a tertiary psychiatric hospital in Singapore
to capture individuals’ self-reported experience with depression and stigmatization
among family and friends. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed
verbatim. Data of 33 young adults (mean age = 26 years, SD =4.6; 18 female,
15 male) were analyzed using thematic analysis.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>In all, four broad themes were developed: (1) absence of support, (2)
provision of unhelpful support, (3) preference for non-disclosure, and
(4) opposition towards formal help-seeking. Lack of awareness of depression
and perpetuation of stigma manifests as barriers towards help-seeking in
the form of absence of support and provision of unhelpful support which
subsequently leads to a preference for non-disclosure, as well as opposition
by family and friends towards formal help-seeking.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Data from this study can contribute to the development of public health
programs aimed at improving awareness and support from family and friends
and facilitating earlier help-seeking among young people with depressive
disorders.</p>
