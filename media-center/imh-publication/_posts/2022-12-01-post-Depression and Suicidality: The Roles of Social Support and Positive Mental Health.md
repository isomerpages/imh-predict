<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Despite being preventable, suicide remains
a leading cause of death globally, with depression being one of the more
prominent risk factors. This study examines the roles of social support
and positive mental health in the depression-suicidality pathway.</p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>We utilized data from the Singapore Mental Health
Study 2016. Social support and positive mental health were examined as
mediators in the relationship between 12-month depression and 12-month
suicidality using survey-weighted generalized structural equation modeling.</p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>Overall positive mental health was found to
partially mediate the relationship between depression and suicide. Of the
discrete positive mental health domains, the depression-suicidality relationship
was partially mediated by general coping and fully mediated by personal
growth and autonomy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>While findings regarding social support were
inconclusive, positive mental health may play a significant role in alleviating
the effects of depression on suicidality. This highlights the multifaceted
nature of suicidality and reveals positive mental health as a new area
in assessing and treating at-risk people, to improve clinical outcomes.HIGHLIGHTSThe
effect of depression on suicidality was partially mediated by overall positive
mental health.General coping partially mediated the relationship between
depression and suicidality.Personal growth and autonomy fully mediated
the relationship between depression and suicidality.</p>
