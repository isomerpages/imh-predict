<h1>Case report: Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of first-episode catatonia in a geriatric case of treatment-resistant depression.&nbsp; Psychiatry Research Case Reports</h1>
<h4>Yanhui Li, Nisha Chandwani</h4>
<p>Multiple authors have discussed challenges in diagnosis and management
of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/catatonia" class="topic-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>catatonia</u></a>,
but there are limited case studies highlighting multiple issues in both
domains concurrently. We present a case of first-episode akinetic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/catatonia" class="topic-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>catatonia</u></a> in
a 63-year-old male with a history of treatment-resistant depression, to
highlight multiple diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/catatonia" class="topic-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>catatonia</u></a> and
discuss learning points. The patient had a likely episode of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/transient-ischemic-attack" class="topic-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>transient ischemic attack</u></a> (TIA)
which precipitated delirium, and subsequently developed catatonia and severe
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hyponatremia" class="topic-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>hyponatremia</u>
</a>. The cause behind his acute catatonia was unclear. Catatonic symptoms
did not improve with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/benzodiazepine" class="topic-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>benzodiazepines</u></a>,
while <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/side-effect" class="topic-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>side effects</u></a> of
oversedation and ongoing delirium limited further uptitration of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/benzodiazepine" class="topic-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>benzodiazepines</u></a>.
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/electroconvulsive-therapy" class="topic-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Electroconvulsive therapy</u>
</a>was also not initiated in view of vascular risks with the recent TIA.
The patient's catatonia subsequently resolved spontaneously with treatment
of his medical conditions. This case highlights the complexity behind identifying
etiologies of catatonia with the interplay of multiple medical conditions
on the background of an affective disorder and ongoing delirium. It also
illustrates therapeutic challenges in the context of unresponsiveness to
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/benzodiazepine" class="topic-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>benzodiazepines</u>
</a>, presence of concomitant delirium and contraindications to initiating
electroconvulsive therapy. We discuss learning points in reference to latest
guidelines in management of catatonia by the British Association of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/psychopharmacology" class="topic-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Psychopharmacology</u></a> (BAP),
and review related literature. We discuss etiologies of catatonia, the
relationship between catatonia and delirium, and offer recommendations
in the face of therapeutic challenges discussed. There is a need for further
research and clarification of guidelines in regard to contraindications
to ECT and management of catatonia with ongoing delirium.</p>
