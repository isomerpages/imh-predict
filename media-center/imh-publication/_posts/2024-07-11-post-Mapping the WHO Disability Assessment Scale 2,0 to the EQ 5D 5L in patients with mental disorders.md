<h3><strong>Objective</strong></h3>
<p>The current study aims to develop an algorithm for mapping the WHODAS
2.0 to the EQ-5D-5 L for patients with mental disorders.</p>
<h3><strong>Methods</strong></h3>
<p>This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Institute of Mental Health
and Community Wellness Clinics in Singapore between June 2019 and November
2022. We included four regression methods including the Ordinary Least
Square (OLS) regression, the Tobit regression model (Tobit), the robust
regression with MM estimator (MM), and the adjusted limited dependent variable
mixture model (ALDVMM) to map EQ-5D-5 L utility scores from the WHODAS
2.0.</p>
<h3><strong>Results</strong></h3>
<p>A total of 797 participants were included. The mean EQ-5D-5 L utility
and WHODAS 2.0 total scores were 0.615 (SD = 0.342) and 11.957 (SD = 8.969),
respectively. We found that the EQ-5D-5 L utility score was best predicted
by the robust regression model with the MM estimator. Our findings suggest
that the WHODAS 2.0 total scores were significantly and inversely associated
with the EQ-5D-5 L utility scores.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>This study provides a mapping algorithm for converting the WHODAS 2.0
scores into EQ-5D-5 L utility scores which can be implemented using a simple
online calculator in the following web application: <a href="https://eastats.shinyapps.io/whodas_eq5d/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://eastats.shinyapps.io/whodas_eq5d/</u></a>.</p>
