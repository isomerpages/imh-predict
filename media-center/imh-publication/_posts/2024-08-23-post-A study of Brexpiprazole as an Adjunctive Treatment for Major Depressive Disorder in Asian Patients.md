<h1><strong>A Real-life Study of Brexpiprazole as an Adjunctive Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder in Asian Patients in Singapore (BADA)</strong></h1>
<h4>Yee Ming Mok, Pei Lin Lynnette Tan, Rohini Bose, Keira Joann Herr, Ken Eng Khean Ung <br></h4>
<p><strong>Objective: </strong>: To investigate the effectiveness and safety
of brexpiprazole as an adjunctive treatment to antidepressant therapy (ADT)
in Asian adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) and inadequate response
in a real-life clinical setting in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>: This was a prospective, observational 3-month
study of patients with MDD who had brexpiprazole added to their existing
ADT. The study was conducted at two sites in Singapore between September
2020 and October 2021. The co-primary endpoints were Patient Health Questionnaire-9
(PHQ-9) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S). Other endpoints
included Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I), Sheehan Disability
Scale (SDS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), and safety.</p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>: Twenty patients were enrolled and 16 completed
the study. There were improvements in PHQ-9, CGI-S, SDS, and GAD-7 scores
from baseline at Week 12, with a mean difference of -4.8, -1.3, -8.5, and
-6.2, respectively. The CGI-I score improved from baseline with a mean
score of 2.3 at Week 12. One third achieved response and 25% achieved remission
based on PHQ-9 scores at Week 12. Similar results were obtained using CGI-S
scores (38% for both). The incidences of adverse events (AEs) and treatment-related
AEs were 55% (11/20) and 50% (10/20), respectively. There were no deaths
or severe AEs. Two patients withdrew brexpiprazole during the study.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>: The observed effects and safety of adjunctive
brexpiprazole in Asian adults with MDD in the real-world setting in Singapore
were consistent with those from clinical trials.</p>
