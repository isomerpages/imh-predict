<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This paper aims to examine the (1) level
of positive mental health (PMH), (2) identify the socio-demographic correlates
of the PMH domains in the general population, and (3) establish if employment
status moderates the relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD)
and PMH among those with a lifetime prevalence of MDD.</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> The Singapore Mental Health Study conducted between
2016 and 2018 included Singapore residents aged ≥18 years. The World Health
Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0 was
utilised to establish lifetime prevalence of MDD. Moderation analysis was
conducted using SPSS PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2017) to assess if employment
status moderated the relationship between MDD and PMH.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Significantly lower PMH total and domain scores
were reported by respondents (n=2,270) who endorsed lifetime MDD compared
to those who did not. Moderation analysis demonstrated that the effect
of MDD on PMH total and domain scores varied considerably across employment
status. Based on the interaction plots, the effect of MDD on both PMH total
and domain scores was minimal among those employed than unemployed.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Healthcare professionals should support the
employment needs of those who report lifetime MDD to provide care for an
individual’s mental well-being in a holistic manner. Acquiring or remaining
in employment would be a priority depending on the PMH of the individual.
Reducing barriers to employment for those with health issues or creating
employment opportunities for this group are concerns that need to be addressed
at a societal level.</p>
