<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>The main aims of the study were to: establish
the average levels of psychological distress, suicidality and positive
mental health (PMH); and examine their associated risk and protective factors
in the population of Singapore during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Method: </strong>Participants from a national psychiatric epidemiological
study conducted in the general population of Singapore from 2016 to 2018,
who had agreed to be re-contacted, were invited to participate in the study
that was conducted from May 2020 to June 2021. Questionnaires assessing
psychological distress, causes of stress, resilience and PMH were administered.</p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>A total of 1,129 respondents completed the study.
The mean age was 47.7 (standard deviation = 16.5) years. The prevalence
of stress, depression and anxiety was 7.1%, 8.0% and 8.4%, respectively.
The final pathways model showed that high concerns related to possible
COVID-19 infection of family members or friends were significantly associated
with higher stress (β = 0.242, P&lt;0.001), depression (β = 0.152, P=0.001)
and anxiety (β = 0.280, P&lt;0.001). High resilience was significantly
associated with lower stress (β = -0.482, P&lt;0.001), depression (β =
-0.394, P&lt;0.001) and anxiety (β = -0.516, P&lt;0.001), and with high
PMH (β = 0.498, P&lt;0.001).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The findings highlight the negative impact
of fear of COVID-19 infection, social distancing and isolation on the mental
health of the population. Resilience and PMH were associated with lower
psychological stress, and interventions to improve these characteristics
can enhance mental health and well-being.</p>
