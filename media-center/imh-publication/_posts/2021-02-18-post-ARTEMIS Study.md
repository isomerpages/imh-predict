<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>After decades of anti-stigma initiatives, the Advancing Research To Eliminate
Mental Illness Stigma (ARTEMIS) intervention study is one of the first
in Singapore to evaluate the&nbsp;effects of an anti-stigma intervention
on attitudes towards depression in university students.</p>
<h3><strong>Methods</strong></h3>
<p>390 university students from a local university in Singapore were voluntarily
recruited for the study. The ARTEMIS intervention comprises an educational
and social contact component, as well as a question and answer (Q&amp;A)
session with experts in the area of mental health. The Community Attitudes
towards Mental Illness (CAMI) scale was administered at baseline, post-intervention
and at 3-months follow-up. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted.</p>
<h3><strong>Results</strong></h3>
<p>The CFA identified a 3-factor model for the CAMI with a decent fit (RMSEA = 0.06,
CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.93, SRMR = 0.06). Favourable shifts in attitudes across
the factors were observed immediately after the intervention (<em>p</em> &lt; &nbsp;0.001).
Gender (β = − 1.19, 95% CI: − 2.10, − 0.27, <em>p</em> = 0.01) and nationality
(β = − 1.23, 95% CI: − 2.35, − 0.11, <em>p</em> = 0.03) were identified
as significant correlates for the community mental health ideology (CMHI)
factor. Linear effects indicated that having a close social contact with
mental illness observed a smaller decrease in authoritarianism scores from
pre- to post-intervention (β = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.53, <em>p</em> = 0.01);
whereas quadratic effects found a greater decrease in scores from post-intervention
to after 3-months&nbsp;for benevolence (β = − 0.34, 95% CI: − 0.52, − 0.16, <em>p</em> &lt; &nbsp;0.001)
and CMHI (β = − 0.22, 95% CI: − 0.45, − 0.002, <em>p</em> = 0.048).</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The anti-stigma intervention shows promising short-term results across
the CAMI dimensions even after adjusting for sociodemographic correlates.
However, the intervention did not observe the sustained attitude shifts
after 3-months. Recommendations for future anti-stigma interventions were
also considered.</p>
