<p><strong>Background: </strong>Social cognition as a transdiagnostic construct
between major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) is not
well understood. This may be attributed to the variability of social cognitive
measures indexing the same construct. This study aims to compare emotion
recognition and theory of mind domains, known to be impaired in SCZ, between
MDD and SCZ.</p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>Three groups of participants (N<sub>Total</sub> =
150) were enrolled in this study: MDD (n = 51), SCZ (n = 50) and healthy
controls (HC; n = 49). Emotion recognition was assessed on the Bell Lysaker
Emotion Recognition Task (BLERT) and Penn Emotion Recognition Task (ER40);
theory of mind was measured on The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT).
Mixed ANCOVAs were utilised to compare social cognitive performance across
the groups.</p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>SCZ performed poorer in all 3 social cognition
tasks compared to both MDD and HC. No statistically significant difference
in social cognitive performance was observed between MDD and HC.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>This study serves as an effort towards employing
the same standardised social cognitive measures for direct comparison of
performance patterns across diagnostic groups. Future work is needed to
extend this in larger samples of different illness severity and diagnostic
categories.</p>
