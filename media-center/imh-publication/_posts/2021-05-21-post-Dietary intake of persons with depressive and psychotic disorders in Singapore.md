<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>Nutritional psychiatry is an emerging field
of study that investigates the role of diet and nutrition in mental health.
Studies conducted in the general population have linked depressive symptoms
with poor dietary patterns. The aim of this study was to characterise the
dietary intake and analyse the dietary pattern using the Dietary Approach
to Stop Hypertension (DASH) in a sample of psychiatric patients in a multiethnic
Asian nation.</p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>Participants were recruited from an outpatient
clinic and an inpatient unit at the Institute of Mental Health in Singapore.
Self-reported dietary habits of a sample of psychiatric patients (N=380)
were analysed using DASH. To examine the variables associated with DASH
scores, a linear regression was conducted with the full sample and sociodemographic
variables.</p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>Persons with depressive disorders had a mean
DASH score of 21.3 (±4.2), while persons with psychotic disorders had a
mean DASH score of 21.2 (±4.9). Respondents who were older (B=1.94, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.91-2.96, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001), female (B=1.09,
95% CI 0.07-2.11, <em>P</em>=0.04) and economically inactive (B=1.98, 95%
CI 0.006-3.96, <em>P</em>=0.049) were more likely to report a higher diet
quality compared with their respective counterparts, while smokers (B=
-1.39, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.34, <em>P</em>=0.009) tended to report a lower
diet quality compared with their non-smoking counterparts.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Dietary patterns of persons with mental disorders
were characterised. A host of sociodemographic factors, and not diagnosis
of mental disorders, influenced the dietary quality of people with depressive
and psychotic disorders. Clinicians treating psychiatric patients need
to be aware of the nuanced reasons behind poor dietary choices and provide
targeted psychoeducation to specific subgroups within the patient population.</p>
