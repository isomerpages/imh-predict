<p>Informal caregivers are crucial to the care of persons with dementia (PWD),
but their role is often reported as challenging. This study aims to examine
caregiver stress and depressive symptoms among informal caregivers of PWD
using a modified transactional stress and coping model. Path analysis was
conducted among a sample of informal caregivers of PWD in Singapore (n
= 281) using information on functional dependence and memory and behavioral
problems of PWD, and self-reported measurements on caregivers' knowledge
of dementia, perceived positive aspects of caregiving, social support,
coping patterns, caregiving self-efficacy, caregiving burden and depressive
symptoms. The initial model reflecting our assumptions for the transactional
stress and coping model showed a poor fit (model 1 - CFI = 0.858, TLI =
0.665, RMSEA = 0.118). Logical modifications were made until sufficient
model fit was achieved (model 2 - CFI = 0.987, TLI = 0.955, RMSEA = 0.043).
We then removed the insignificant paths in model 2 and obtained our final
model (model 3 - CFI = 0.990, TLI = 0.974, RMSEA = 0.033). The final model
supported our hypotheses, with some adjustments. This study advances our
understanding of caregiver distress by modifying the transactional stress
and coping model, including (1) the key role of caregiver self-efficacy
in the primary appraisal process, (2) the dynamic assessment of coping
resources across all stages of the model, and (3) the importance of coping
patterns. Future studies could explore the generalizability of these findings.</p>
