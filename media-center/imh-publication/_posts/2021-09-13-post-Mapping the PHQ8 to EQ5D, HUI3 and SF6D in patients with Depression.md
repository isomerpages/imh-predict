<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>There is limited evidence of mapping clinical instruments to a generic
preference-based instrument in Asian patient populations. The current study
aims to map the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale
(PHQ-8) onto the EuroQol Five-Dimension (EQ-5D), the Health Utilities Index
Mark 3 (HUI3) and the Short Form&nbsp;Six-Dimension (SF-6D) which helps
to inform future cost-utility analyses of treatments for depression.</p>
<h3><strong>Methods</strong></h3>
<p>A total of 249 participants who had completed PHQ-8, EQ-5D, SF-6D and
HUI3 questionnaires were included in the analyses. A beta regression mixture
model was used to map the utility scores as a function of PHQ-8 total scores,&nbsp;PHQ-squared,
age and gender. The predictive accuracy of the models was examined using
mean absolute error and root mean square error.</p>
<h3><strong>Results</strong></h3>
<p>The results were compared against two common regression methods including
Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Tobit regression models. The mean age of
the sample was 36.2 years (SD = 11.1). The mean EQ-5D-3L,&nbsp;EQ-5D-5L,
HUI3 and SF-6D utility scores were 0.615, 0.709, 0.461 and 0.607, respectively.
The EQ-5D-3L, EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D utility scores were best predicted by
the beta mixture regression model consisting of PHQ-8 total sores, PHQ-squared,
and covariates including age and gender. The HUI3 was best predicted by
the OLS regression&nbsp;model.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>
<p>The current study provides important evidence to clinicians and researchers
about the mapping algorithms that can be used in economic evaluation among
patients with depression.</p>
