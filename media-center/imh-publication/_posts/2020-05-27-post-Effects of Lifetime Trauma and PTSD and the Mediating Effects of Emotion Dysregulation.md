<h1>Global emotion dysregulation and maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies mediate the effects of severe trauma on depressive and positive symptoms in early non-affective psychosis</h1>

<p><strong>Background: </strong>Previous research has shown that childhood
trauma contributes to the onset and maintenance of psychosis. However,
few studies have accounted for the effects of lifetime trauma and post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), and none have examined the mediating role of emotion
dysregulation in symptom maintenance after severe trauma. The purpose of
this study is to determine whether maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation
strategies (CERS) and global emotion dysregulation mediate the effects
of probable PTSD on depressive symptoms, and whether this pathway extends
to influence positive symptoms in patients with early non-affective psychotic
disorders.</p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>A total of 150 outpatients with early non-affective
psychosis were assessed for trauma exposure, DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, CERS,
global emotion dysregulation, and current depressive and positive symptoms.
Parallel and serial mediation analyses based on ordinary least squares
regressions were used to test the hypothesized models.</p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>Mediation analyses controlling for gender, psychiatric
comorbidities, antipsychotic medication dosage, duration of untreated psychosis
(DUP), family history of mental illness, and cumulative trauma revealed
that maladaptive CERS (rumination, catastrophic thinking, and self-blame)
and global emotion dysregulation mediated the effects of probable PTSD
on depressive symptoms (R<sup>2</sup> = 41%), while maladaptive CERS, global
emotion dysregulation, and depressive symptoms mediated the effects of
probable PTSD on positive symptoms (R<sup>2</sup> = 30%).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Our results demonstrate the indirect effects
of maladaptive CERS and global emotion dysregulation on maintaining depressive
and positive symptoms. Emotion dysregulation may be a potential transdiagnostic
treatment target to alleviate depressive and positive symptoms in traumatized
patients with early non-affective psychosis.</p>
