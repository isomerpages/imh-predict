<p>The period of youth encompasses a myriad of experiences that often elicit
a range of emotions from the individual. This study was conducted to understand
emotion regulation (ER) among youths, specifically to identify strategies
employed by youths to regulate emotions, and to understand the perceived
importance and impact of ER. Qualitative data were collected through one-to-one
semi-structured interviews (<em>n</em> = 25) and focus group discussions
(<em>n</em> = 11; total 70 participants) among youths aged between 15 and
24 years. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and inductive thematic analysis
was used to analyze the data. ER strategies engaged by youths in this study
were classified into the following themes: (1) developing emotional awareness
and acceptance, (2) emotional catharsis, (3) calling for a timeout, and
(4) positive thinking and reframing. Youths perceived the importance of
regulating emotions as (1) ER contributes to rational thinking and decision-making,
(2) poor ER worsens mental wellbeing, (3) ER provides stability in life,
and has (4) relevance to current life stage and environment. Findings from
this study illustrate the essential role of ER for youth’s healthy functioning
and demonstrate the value of strengthening emotional regulatory capacities
in them.</p>
