<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Global emotion dysregulation mediates the
relationship between child maltreatment and severe depressive symptoms;
however, there is a lack of research on maladaptive personality traits
and their contribution to individual differences in global emotion dysregulation
within this conceptual model. The present study tested a preliminary serial
mediation model where maladaptive personality traits and global emotion
dysregulation mediate the relationship between child maltreatment and severe
depressive symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Method: </strong>A total of 200 patients with mood disorders (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> =
36.5 years; 54% females) were assessed for maladaptive personality traits
(Personality Inventory for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders [5th ed.] Brief Form), global emotion dysregulation (Difficulties
in Emotion Regulation Scale-Short), childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma
Questionnaire), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9).</p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>Ordinary least squares regression and partial
least squares-structural equation modeling revealed a consistent and significant
indirect effect of child maltreatment on severe depressive symptoms through
negative affectivity, detachment, psychoticism, and global emotion dysregulation.
Among child maltreatment types, only emotional abuse had a significant
indirect effect on severe depressive symptoms through maladaptive personality
traits and global emotion dysregulation, <em>b</em> = 0.50, <em>SE</em> = 0.09,
95% confidence intervals [0.326, 0.694] after controlling for age, gender,
and remaining types of child maltreatment.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Findings support the view that maladaptive
personality traits shed important insights on individual differences in
global emotion dysregulation, and this information could aid clinical formulation
and treatment of childhood adversity-related psychopathology. (PsycInfo
