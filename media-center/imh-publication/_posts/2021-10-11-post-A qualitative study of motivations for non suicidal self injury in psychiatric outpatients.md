<h1><strong>A qualitative study of motivations for non-suicidal self-injury in a sample of psychiatric outpatients in Singapore</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>The popular notion that the need for attention
drives non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) serves to stigmatise rather than
understand this warning sign of underlying psychological/psychiatric disorder.
Despite the pervasiveness of NSSI in clinical and community settings, effective
treatments for this behaviour are lacking. This qualitative research aims
to understand the motivations of NSSI in adolescents/young adults in a
mental health facility in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with
20 outpatients (6 males, 14 females) of the Institute of Mental Health
aged 17-29 years who had reported NSSI as part of an earlier survey. The
interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis
was used to analyse the data. The main themes and sub-themes were identified
and described.</p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>A preponderance of motivations served intrapersonal
emotion-regulating purposes, which were categorised as to: (a) release
bottled-up feelings; (b) self-punish; (c) turn aggression inwards; (d)
sensitise oneself; and (e) attain a sense of control and mastery. By contrast,
a small subset of motivations served the interpersonal motivation of signaling
one's distress, especially when the capacity for verbal expression was
limited or attempts to verbalise distress were futile.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Committing NSSI solely for attention-seeking
is a myth that perpetuates the stigma and hinders those in need of psychological
care from seeking appropriate treatment. NSSIs may be warning signs that
indicate not only intrapersonal conflicts but external environments that
are perceived unsafe to deal with these intrapersonal conflicts. An understanding
of the underlying motives will facilitate better treatment of individuals
presenting with NSSI.</p>
