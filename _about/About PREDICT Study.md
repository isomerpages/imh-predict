<p>In the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) study, Prins
et al. (2011) found that patients with anxiety or depressive disorders
receiving either guideline-concordant or non-guideline-concordant treatment
improved equally over a one-year period. However, the long-term course
of depressive disorders using 6-year follow-up data showed that chronicity
is the rule rather than the exception (Verduijn, et al. 2017). Furthermore,
patients who were older, unemployed, with intermediate education, with
poor social networks, comorbid anxiety, and depression, and had more severe
symptoms at baseline were more likely to retain a moderate/high symptom
level at follow-up. Longitudinal studies are valuable for identifying vulnerable
patient sub-groups and informing appropriate interventions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a well-established cohort also allows for nested studies to be
designed, implemented and to evaluate relevant interventions. Extended
periods of follow-up provide a more accurate and nuanced account of disease
trajectory and prognosis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the high risk of recurrence, durable prevention and mitigation strategies
are needed. Identifying patient segments at an increased risk of recurrence
is essential for a population health strategy. In the Healthier SG movement
context, the proposed longitudinal study is anticipated to inform the development
of clinical interventions, social prescriptions, and care protocols for
depression. When offered in a timely manner, these interventions will improve
the quality of life for patients and carers, guide resource planning and
optimize healthcare utilisation.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>With the Healthier SG initiative, there is an effort to empower healthcare
professionals in primary care with the capabilities to manage anxiety and
depression. Mental health primary care protocols for these conditions are
expected to be launched in the coming years. Concurrently, the Ministry
of Health and the Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being
(TMW) are developing a tiered system of services to improve accessibility,
coordination, and quality of mental health services. The Healthier SG initiatives
and the tiered system of services will result in the identification of
more mild and moderate cases of depression and their management in the
primary care setting. Therefore, the proposed study is timely in that it
will generate insights to inform the development and iteration of these
new care models in Singapore.</p>
<p>The proposed study will evaluate the prognosis of depression across the
entire continuum of care, recruiting cases from primary and tertiary care
settings and, across different age groups. This study will thus be able
to track the right siting of care, trajectories of care, and outcomes across
settings and age groups. For participants agreeable to data linkage, data
from medical records will also be captured across primary, secondary, and
tertiary care settings.</p>

<summary>Theme 3</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The study will include assessments of several psychosocial factors that
have been shown to influence the development and course of depression.
Using a machine learning approach, Wardenaar et al. (2021) examined the
common and specific determinants of the 9-year trajectory of depression
in their cohort. The most significant determinants were age, younger age
of onset, mastery (of goals), loneliness, visiting a mental health institute,
substance use, somatic disease, extraversion, and functioning score. The
determinants of depression have not been well studied in Singapore.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given our multi-ethnic population and diverse socio-cultural
backgrounds, there is likely to be a plurality of bio-psycho-social determinants
that results in depression amongst Singaporeans. Therefore, it is imperative
that research be conducted to elucidate these determinants, which will
contribute to holistic strategies to address depression in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is increasing recognition that patients with depression die prematurely
due to chronic medical disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
and cancer (Chang et al., 2010; Olaya et al., 2023). Those with depression
develop these illnesses at an earlier age due to both maladaptive health
risk behaviors as well as the physiologic effects of their psychiatric
illnesses. There is also evidence that the distress, symptom burden, functional
impairment, and physiologic changes associated with chronic medical conditions
may worsen the course of depression. Multiple factors have been suggested
that can mediate the adverse effect of comorbid depression on cardio-metabolic
disorders. This proposed study will therefore conduct routine assays for
metabolic functions – such as blood glucose and lipid assays, kidney and
liver function tests, and haematocrit to examine the development of medical
comorbidity and its impact on depression.</p>

<p>Subsyndromal depression or SD is defined as the presence of clinically
relevant levels of depressive symptoms without meeting the diagnostic criteria
for MDD as established by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 4th Edition
(DSM-IV) (Ebert et al., 2018). SD has a marked adverse impact on quality
of life; it causes functional impairment and is associated with significant
utilisation of healthcare services (Subramaniam et al., 2016). It is also
a strong risk factor for developing MDD (Cuijpers et al., 2004, Zhang et
al., 2022). A recent meta-analysis estimated the summary prevalence of
SD across 113 studies from multiple countries to be 11.02% (Zhang et al.,
2022). The prevalence of SD in Singapore is unknown, but it is anticipated
to be higher than MDD. Therefore, SD represents a valuable opportunity
to intervene and prevent the progression toward MDD. The proposed study
cohort could provide insights into the prevalence, and course of SD and
potential preventive interventions in this cohort to prevent the onset
of depression.</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
<p>Globally, depression affects approximately 4% of the population annually,
with about 280 million people affected <sup>1 </sup>. The COVID-19 pandemic
has worsened mental health conditions worldwide, leading to around 53 million
additional cases of depression (a 27.6% increase) in the global population <sup>2</sup> .</p>
<p>Depression can significantly impair daily functioning, preventing affected
individuals from effectively fulfilling their academic, occupational, social,
and family roles <sup>3 , 4</sup> . It is also among the leading causes of
burden worldwide. Based on the Singapore Mental Health Study (SMHS) in
2016, the lifetime and annual prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder in
Singapore were 6.3% and 2.3%, respectively <sup>5</sup>. While the burden
of MDD alone has not been determined, mental disorders, excluding substance
use disorders, contributed to 10% of total Disability Adjusted Life Years
(DALYs) in Singapore <sup>6 </sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development of depressive disorders is believed to be influenced by
various biological, psychological, and social factors <sup>7</sup> . Similarly,
the prognosis of depression is determined by numerous factors. There is
limited data on the long-term course and outcomes of depression in Singapore.</p>
<p>Most of the available data comes from cross-sectional nationwide epidemiological
studies like the SMHS 2010, SMHS 2016, and the Wellbeing of the Singapore
Elderly (WiSE) study. However, these studies have limitations and do not
provide comprehensive information on the long-term trajectory and outcomes
of individuals with mental disorders. This lack of local data hampers the
ability of clinicians and policymakers to plan for acute and chronic care
of patients with mental disorders effectively.</p>
<p>While prospective cohorts require a lot of resources and time, they provide
the most reliable results in observational epidemiology and biological
psychiatry <sup>8</sup> . One well-established cohort is the Netherlands
Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) <sup>9 </sup>, which has 13 years
of follow-up data on depression and anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH), National Healthcare Group Polyclinics
(NHGP), Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), Duke-NUS Medical
School, Usher Institution-The University of Edinburgh, and the Netherlands
Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) Cohort are collaborating to establish
a well-characterized depression cohort in Singapore to ensure a comprehensive
understanding of depressive disorders over a five-year period.</p>
<p>Additionally, the study will focus on subsyndromal depression (SSD), characterized
by significant depressive symptoms that do not meet MDD criteria. SSD is
a strong risk factor for MDD and impacts quality of life. By understanding
SSD's prevalence and progression, the study aims to develop preventive
interventions.</p>
<p>This research will provide data to inform clinical interventions, social
prescriptions, and care protocols, enhancing depression management and
resource planning in Singapore's healthcare system.</p>
