in neuroscience (psychosis), and has led a group of researchers comprising
epidemiologists, biostatisticians and health service researchers who are
part of the Programme of Mental Health Policy. He has authored more than
400 journals articles, several in high impact journals that have contributed
to a deeper understanding of psychosis, psychopharmacology and stigma towards
mental illness. Professor Chong is also on the editorial board of several
journals and is on the panel of expert contributors for the Strait Times
- and his Op-Ed pieces have created a deeper understanding and empathy
towards those with mental illnesses. He will be involved in training research
staff and providing support for setting up the cohort. He has also conducted
several clinical trials and will lend his expertise to develop the protocols
for interventional studies. He will also lead the recruitment and assessment
of participants.</p>
