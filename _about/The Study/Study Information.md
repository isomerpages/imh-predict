<h1>Study Information</h1>
<h2>Study Background Information</h2>
<p>Globally, depression affects approximately 4% of the population annually,
with about 280 million people affected 1 . The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened
mental health conditions worldwide, leading to around 53 million additional
cases of depression (a 27.6% increase) in the global population 2 .</p>
<p>Depression can significantly impair daily functioning, preventing affected
individuals from effectively fulfilling their academic, occupational, social,
and family roles 3 , 4 . It is also among the leading causes of burden
worldwide. Based on the Singapore Mental Health Study (SMHS) in 2016, the
lifetime and annual prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder in Singapore
were 6.3% and 2.3%, respectively 5. While the burden of MDD alone has not
been determined, mental disorders, excluding substance use disorders, contributed
to 10% of total Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in Singapore 6 .&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development of depressive disorders is believed to be influenced by
various biological, psychological, and social factors 7 . Similarly, the
prognosis of depression is determined by numerous factors. There is limited
data on the long-term course and outcomes of depression in Singapore.</p>
<p>Most of the available data comes from cross-sectional nationwide epidemiological
studies like the SMHS 2010, SMHS 2016, and the Wellbeing of the Singapore
Elderly (WiSE) study. However, these studies have limitations and do not
provide comprehensive information on the long-term trajectory and outcomes
of individuals with mental disorders. This lack of local data hampers the
ability of clinicians and policymakers to plan for acute and chronic care
of patients with mental disorders effectively.</p>
<p>While prospective cohorts require a lot of resources and time, they provide
the most reliable results in observational epidemiology and biological
psychiatry 8 . One well-established cohort is the Netherlands Study of
Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) 9 , which has 13 years of follow-up data
on depression and anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH), National Healthcare Group Polyclinics
(NHGP), Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), Duke-NUS Medical
School, Usher Institution-The University of Edinburgh, and the Netherlands
Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) Cohort are collaborating to establish
a well-characterized depression cohort in Singapore to ensure a comprehensive
understanding of depressive disorders over a five-year period.</p>
<h2>Study Goals</h2>
<p>This cohort study aims to gain a deeper understanding of determinants,
disease progression, disease outcomes, and early identification of subgroups
with good or poor prognoses among those with depression and subsyndromal
depression in Singapore.</p>
