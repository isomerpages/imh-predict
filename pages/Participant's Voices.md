 We recently participated in a six-year study on the causes of depression
among adults in Singapore reported in the Straits Times on 22 May 2025.
My wife, sister, and I applied and were accepted into the control group,
after a screening process and a main interview, conveniently conducted
via Teams. This saved us a trip to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). <br>The researchers spoke with us individually and emailed us detailed information
about the assessments, procedures, and consent requirements, emphasizing
participant confidentiality. Following this, we made an onsite visit to
provide blood samples and complete additional documentation. We particularly
appreciated their thoughtful gesture of providing drinks and snacks after
our blood tests, especially since we had to fast for the procedure. We
were pleasantly surprised to receive our blood test results via email within
just a few days. They were also flexible in allowing us to complete a questionnaire
about our mental/medical health and family history online instead of onsite.
&nbsp;
<br>Overall, our experience in applying for and participating in the study
was smooth and proceeded at a comfortable pace.&nbsp;<p></p>

My husband and I participated in the PREDICT research study after we chanced
upon it while googling. During our interactions with the IMH staff, we
were very impressed by their patience and professionalism. They explained
the study in detail and allowed us to ask questions and seek clarifications.
It was also very heartwarming to see Pratika standing at the drop off point
to wait for us to arrive during the in-person part of the study. Another
plus about&nbsp; participating in the study was the comprehensive blood
test results that were provided to us, just one day after the blood was
taken. . All in all, the overall experience was really smooth, efficient
and seamless. We encourage everyone who qualifies for this research study
to participate.
